            <h2>A Little Background</h2>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>I graduated with a Masters in Entrepreneurship from the University of Surrey in 2018. Before that I acquired and undergraduate in 
                Business Management and Economics from the University of Roehampton. As such, I have acquired experience in crowdfunding and entreprenerusial 
                consultation. <br>Prior to joinging the _Nology course I worked at Enterprise Rent-a-Car as a Management Trainee.

            <h2>_Nology Course</h2>
            <p>The course I'm currently enrolled in at _Nology is a 6 week intensive course that provides the comprehensive training I need to enter the field 
                of IT as a Technical Analyst. They will provide training in business and developmentpractices as well as provide technical skills like Git training,
                HTML coding, and Data visualisation. It is the perfect stepping stone I need to eventually land a role in Data Sience.

            <h2>Hobbies and Activities</h2>
                <h3>Languages</h3>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>The pivot of my personal life is language learning. My mother tongue is Urdu and I have a good comprehension of Arabic. I can speak it to an 
                    intermediate level. I have a list of languages I'd like to learn including Spanish, Farsi, and Russian, and I plan to be a ployglot before 30!</p>
                <h3>Skateboarding</h3>
                <p>A recent hobby of mine, I love the systematic approach to leanring new skills. First you learn the ollie, then the kickflip builds on that. I 
                    definitely see myself carrying this on until at least I learn to "strawberry milkshake". --> It looks so smooth!
                </p>
                <h3>Muay Thai</h3>
                <p>Prior to lockdown I was enjoying some brutal Muay Thai training sessions. Waiting for the situation to ease before i return.</p>
                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>Fiction, history, classics, you name it I'll read it :)</p>
